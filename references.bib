  abstract = {Forty years ago, Wiesner pointed out that quantum mechanics raises the striking possibility of money that cannot be counterfeited according to the laws of physics. We propose the first quantum money scheme that is (1) public-key, meaning that anyone can verify a banknote as genuine, not only the bank that printed it, and (2) cryptographically secure, under a "classical" hardness assumption that has nothing to do with quantum money. Our scheme is based on hidden subspaces, encoded as the zero-sets of random multivariate polynomials. A main technical advance is to show that the "black-box" version of our scheme, where the polynomials are replaced by classical oracles, is unconditionally secure. Previously, such a result had only been known relative to a quantum oracle (and even there, the proof was never published). Even in Wiesner's original setting -- quantum money that can only be verified by the bank -- we are able to use our techniques to patch a major security hole in Wiesner's scheme. We give the first private-key quantum money scheme that allows unlimited verifications and that remains unconditionally secure, even if the counterfeiter can interact adaptively with the bank. Our money scheme is simpler than previous public-key quantum money schemes, including a knot-based scheme of Farhi et al. The verifier needs to perform only two tests, one in the standard basis and one in the Hadamard basis -- matching the original intuition for quantum money, based on the existence of complementary observables. Our security proofs use a new variant of Ambainis's quantum adversary method, and several other tools that might be of independent interest.},

  abstract = {The Bell's states or EPR pairs:{$\mkern1mu$}25{$\mkern1mu$} are specific quantum states of two qubits that represent the simplest (and maximal) examples of quantum entanglement; conceptually, they fall under the study of quantum information science. The Bell's states are a form of entangled and normalized basis vectors. This normalization implies that the overall probability of the particle being in one of the mentioned states is 1:                         {$\langle$}         {$\Phi$}                    |                  {$\Phi$}         {$\rangle$}         =         1                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash langle \textbackslash Phi |\textbackslash Phi \textbackslash rangle =1\}   . Entanglement is a basis-independent result of superposition. Due to this superposition, measurement of the qubit will "collapse" it into one of its basis states with a given probability. Because of the entanglement, measurement of one qubit will "collapse" the other qubit to a state whose measurement will yield one of two possible values, where the value depends on which Bell's state the two qubits are in initially.  Bell's states can be generalized to certain quantum states of multi-qubit systems, such as the GHZ state for 3 or more subsystems. Understanding of Bell's states is useful in analysis of quantum communication, such as superdense coding and quantum teleportation. The no-communication theorem prevents this behavior from transmitting information faster than the speed of light.},

  abstract = {In quantum mechanics and computing, the Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of the pure state space of a two-level quantum mechanical system (qubit), named after the physicist Felix Bloch.Quantum mechanics is mathematically formulated in Hilbert space or projective Hilbert space.  The pure states of a quantum system correspond to the one-dimensional subspaces of the corresponding Hilbert space (and the "points" of the projective Hilbert space).  For a two-dimensional Hilbert space, the space of all such states is the complex projective line                                                 C             P                                   1                             .                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash mathbb \{CP\} \^\{1\}.\}    This is the Bloch sphere, which can be mapped to the Riemann sphere. The Bloch sphere is a unit 2-sphere, with antipodal points corresponding to a pair of mutually orthogonal state vectors.  The north and south poles of the Bloch sphere are typically chosen to correspond to the standard basis vectors                                    |                  0         {$\rangle$}                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle |0\textbackslash rangle \}    and                                    |                  1         {$\rangle$}                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle |1\textbackslash rangle \}   , respectively, which in turn might correspond e.g. to the spin-up and spin-down states of an electron.  This choice is arbitrary, however.  The points on the surface of the sphere correspond to the pure states of the system, whereas the interior points correspond to the mixed states.  The Bloch sphere may be generalized to an n-level quantum system, but then the visualization is less useful. For historical reasons, in optics the Bloch sphere is also known as the Poincar\'e sphere and specifically represents different types of polarizations.  Six common polarization types exist and are called Jones vectors.  Indeed Henri Poincar\'e was the first to suggest the use of this kind of geometrical representation at the end of 19th century, as a three-dimensional representation of Stokes parameters. The natural metric on the Bloch sphere is the Fubini\textendash Study metric.  The mapping from the unit 3-sphere in the two-dimensional state space                                                 C                                   2                                     \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash mathbb \{C\} \^\{2\}\}    to the Bloch sphere is the Hopf fibration, with each ray of spinors mapping to one point on the Bloch sphere.},

  abstract = {Unlike classical money, which is hard to forge for practical reasons (e.g. producing paper with a certain property), quantum money is attractive because its security might be based on the no-cloning theorem. The first quantum money scheme was introduced by Wiesner circa 1970. Although more sophisticated quantum money schemes were proposed, Wiesner's scheme remained appealing because it is both conceptually clean and relatively easy to implement. We show efficient adaptive attacks on Wiesner's quantum money scheme [Wie83] (and its variant by Bennett et al. [BBBW83]), when valid money is accepted and passed on, while invalid money is destroyed. We propose two attacks, the first is inspired by the Elitzur-Vaidman bomb testing problem [EV93, KWH+95], while the second is based on the idea of protective measurements [AAV93]. It allows us to break Wiesner's scheme with 4 possible states per qubit, and generalizations which use more than 4 states per qubit.},

We also present network for an optimal quantum copying ``machine'' (transformation) which produces N+1 identical copies from the original qubit. Here again the quality (fidelity) of the copies does not depend on the state of the original and is only a function of the number of copies, N. In addition, we present the machine which universaly and optimally clones states of quantum objects in arbitrary-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

  abstract = {Banknotes of the euro, the common currency of the eurozone (euro area members), have been in circulation since the first series (also called ES1) was issued in 2002. They are issued by the national central banks of the Eurosystem or the European Central Bank. The euro was established in 1999, but "for the first three years it was an invisible currency, used for accounting purposes only, e.g. in electronic payments". In 2002, notes and coins began to circulate. The euro rapidly took over from the former national currencies and slowly expanded around the European Union. Denominations of the notes range from \texteuro 5 to \texteuro 500 and, unlike euro coins, the design is identical across the whole of the eurozone, although they are issued and printed in various member states. The euro banknotes are pure cotton fibre, which improves their durability as well as giving the banknotes a distinctive feel. They measure from 120 by 62 millimetres (4.7 in \texttimes{} 2.4 in) to 160 by 82 millimetres (6.3 in \texttimes{} 3.2 in) and have a variety of color schemes. The euro notes contain many complex security features such as watermarks, invisible ink characteristics, holograms, optically variable inks and microprinting that document their authenticity. While euro coins have a national side indicating the country of issue (although not necessarily of minting), euro notes lack this. Instead, this information is shown by the first character of each note's serial number. According to European Central Bank estimates, in December 2022, there were about 29.450 billion banknotes in circulation around the eurozone, with a total value of about \texteuro 1.572 trillion. On 8 November 2012, the ECB announced that the first series of notes would be replaced by the Europa series (also called ES2), starting with the 5 euro note on 2 May 2013. This series does not have a \texteuro 500 note, as the ECB have decided to permanently cease its production over concerns that it could facilitate illicit activities.Estimates suggest that the average life of a euro banknote is about three years before replacement due to wear, but with a wide variation by denomination level, from less than a year for \texteuro 5 banknotes to over 30 years for \texteuro 500 banknotes, on average. High denomination banknotes (\texteuro 100, \texteuro 200, \texteuro 500) typically last longer as they are less frequently used. The Europa series lower denomination \texteuro 5 and \texteuro 10 banknotes are designed to last longer, thanks to additional coating.},

  abstract = {The digital currency Bitcoin has had remarkable growth since it was first proposed in 2008. Its distributed nature allows currency transactions without a central authority by using cryptographic methods and a data structure called the blockchain. In this paper we use the no-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics to introduce Quantum Bitcoin, a Bitcoin-like currency that runs on a quantum computer. We show that our construction of quantum shards and two blockchains allows untrusted peers to mint quantum money without risking the integrity of the currency. The Quantum Bitcoin protocol has several advantages over classical Bitcoin, including immediate local verification of transactions. This is a major improvement since we no longer need the computationally intensive and time-consuming method Bitcoin uses to record all transactions in the blockchain. Instead, Quantum Bitcoin only records newly minted currency which drastically reduces the footprint and increases efficiency. We present formal security proofs for counterfeiting resistance and show that a quantum bitcoin can be re-used a large number of times before wearing out - just like ordinary coins and banknotes. Quantum Bitcoin is the first distributed quantum money system and we show that the lack of a paper trail implies full anonymity for the users. In addition, there are no transaction fees and the system can scale to any transaction volume.},

Generalizations in which other ensembles of states are substituted for the one considered by Wiesner are also discussed, including a scheme recently proposed by Pastawski, Yao, Jiang, Lukin, and Cirac, as well as schemes based on higher dimensional quantum systems. In addition, we introduce a variant of Wiesner's quantum money in which the verification protocol for bank notes involves only classical communication with the bank. We show that the optimal probability with which a counterfeiter can succeed in two independent verification attempts, given access to a single valid n-qubit bank note, is (3/4+sqrt(2)/8)\^n. We also analyze extensions of this variant to higher-dimensional schemes.},

  abstract = {In physics, the no-cloning theorem states that it is impossible to create an independent and identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state, a statement which has profound implications in the field of quantum computing among others. The theorem is an evolution of the 1970 no-go theorem authored by James Park, in which he demonstrates that a non-disturbing measurement scheme which is both simple and perfect cannot exist (the same result would be independently derived in 1982 by Wootters and Zurek as well as Dieks the same year). The aforementioned theorems do not preclude the state of one system becoming entangled with the state of another as cloning specifically refers to the creation of a separable state with identical factors. For example, one might use the controlled NOT gate and the Walsh\textendash Hadamard gate to entangle two qubits without violating the no-cloning theorem as no well-defined state may be defined in terms of a subsystem of an entangled state. The no-cloning theorem (as generally understood) concerns only pure states whereas the generalized statement regarding mixed states is known as the no-broadcast theorem. The no-cloning theorem has a time-reversed dual, the no-deleting theorem.  Together, these underpin the interpretation of quantum mechanics in terms of category theory, and, in particular, as a dagger compact category. This formulation, known as categorical quantum mechanics, allows, in turn, a connection to be made from quantum mechanics to linear logic as the logic of quantum information theory (in the same sense that intuitionistic logic arises from Cartesian closed categories).},

  abstract = {In mathematical physics and mathematics, the Pauli matrices are a set of three 2 \texttimes{} 2 complex matrices which are Hermitian, involutory and unitary.  Usually indicated by the Greek letter sigma ({$\sigma$}), they are occasionally denoted by tau ({$\tau$}) when used in connection with isospin symmetries. These matrices are named after the physicist Wolfgang Pauli. In quantum mechanics, they occur in the Pauli equation which takes into account the interaction of the spin of a particle with an external electromagnetic field. They also represent the interaction states of two polarization filters for horizontal/vertical polarization, 45 degree polarization (right/left), and circular polarization (right/left). Each Pauli matrix is Hermitian, and together with the identity matrix I (sometimes considered as the zeroth Pauli matrix {$\sigma$}0), the Pauli matrices form a basis for the real vector space of 2 \texttimes{} 2 Hermitian matrices.  This means that any 2 \texttimes{} 2 Hermitian matrix can be written in a unique way as a linear combination of Pauli matrices, with all coefficients being real numbers. Hermitian operators represent observables in quantum mechanics, so the Pauli matrices span the space of observables of the complex 2-dimensional Hilbert space. In the context of Pauli's work, {$\sigma$}k represents the observable corresponding to spin along the kth coordinate axis in three-dimensional Euclidean space                                                 R                                   3                             .                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash mathbb \{R\} \^\{3\}.\}     The Pauli matrices (after multiplication by i to make them anti-Hermitian) also generate transformations in the sense of Lie algebras: the matrices i{$\sigma$}1, i{$\sigma$}2, i{$\sigma$}3  form a basis for the real Lie algebra                                                 s             u                             (         2         )                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \{\textbackslash mathfrak \{su\}\}(2)\}   , which exponentiates to the special unitary group SU(2).

  abstract = {Photon polarization is the quantum mechanical description of the classical polarized sinusoidal plane electromagnetic wave. An individual photon can be described as having right or left circular polarization, or a superposition of the two. Equivalently, a photon can be described as having horizontal or vertical linear polarization, or a superposition of the two. The description of photon polarization contains many of the physical concepts and much of the mathematical machinery of more involved quantum descriptions, such as the quantum mechanics of an electron in a potential well. Polarization is an example of a qubit degree of freedom, which forms a fundamental basis for an understanding of more complicated quantum phenomena. Much of the mathematical machinery of quantum mechanics, such as state vectors, probability amplitudes, unitary operators, and Hermitian operators, emerge naturally from the classical Maxwell's equations in the description. The quantum polarization state vector for the photon, for instance, is identical with the Jones vector, usually used to describe the polarization of a classical wave. Unitary operators emerge from the classical requirement of the conservation of energy of a classical wave propagating through lossless media that alter the polarization state of the wave. Hermitian operators then follow for infinitesimal transformations of a classical polarization state. Many of the implications of the mathematical machinery are easily verified experimentally. In fact, many of the experiments can be performed with polaroid sunglass lenses. The connection with quantum mechanics is made through the identification of a minimum packet size, called a photon, for energy in the electromagnetic field. The identification is based on the theories of Planck and the interpretation of those theories by Einstein. The correspondence principle then allows the identification of momentum and angular momentum (called spin), as well as energy, with the photon.},

Then we present a way of realizing optimal universal cloning based on stimulated parametric down-conversion. This scheme also implements the optimal universal NOT operation.},

  abstract = {If a photon of definite polarization encounters an excited atom, there is typically some nonvanishing probability that the atom will emit a second photon by stimulated emission. Such a photon is guaranteed to have the same polarization as the original photon. But is it possible by this or any other process to amplify a quantum state, that is, to produce several copies of a quantum system (the polarized photon in the present case) each having the same state as the original? If it were, the amplifying process could be used to ascertain the exact state of a quantum system: in the case of a photon, one could determine its polarization by first producing a beam of identically polarized copies and then measuring the Stokes parameters1. We show here that the linearity of quantum mechanics forbids such replication and that this conclusion holds for all quantum systems.},
